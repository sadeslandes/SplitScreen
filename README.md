# SplitScreen
Split Screen is a desktop app for both OSX and Windows that will aim at allowing for custom “partitioning” of a user’s desktop.  The app would allow for the user to configure their desktop, from several preloaded templates to make their windows for different apps snap into a specific orientation indicated by the template depending on the location of where the user wants it.
